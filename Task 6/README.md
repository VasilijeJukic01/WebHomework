# Public Blog

This is a public platform for publishing posts/articles where anyone can contribute. The platform allows users to add new posts containing the author's name, title, and content. All users can view published posts, comment on them, and read comments.

## Technical Requirements
- Client should login before he can post and write comments.
- The client requires that the web application is single-page (all subsequent actions should be implemented using AJAX requests)
- For server-side implementation, use the JAX-RS specification for RESTful API.
- Store posts and their comments in relational database.
